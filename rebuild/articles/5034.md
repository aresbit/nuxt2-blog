The Rust programming language can be confusing for beginners, and the module system is one part that causes frustration particularly often. There are <wdautohl-customtag style="font-weight:bold;color:blue;font-size:inherit;display:inline;" id="wdautohl_id_2" class="wdautohl_cXVpdGUgYSBmZXc_">quite a few</wdautohl-customtag> blog posts out there trying to explain the module system in a simple way, but I often have the feeling that they over-simplify things. So here‚Äôs my take‚Äî‚Äãa more detailed explanation of the module system.

This post assumes that you can write at least a ‚Äúhello world‚Äù Rust program. It‚Äôs a rather long read, so get comfortable, maybe with a cup of tea, hot chocolate, or whatever your heart desires üòä

## [](#why-do-modules-exist)Why do modules exist?

Modules give your code _structure_: Dividing your code into modules is like dividing your house into several rooms: Each room has a different purpose, and rooms can be locked for privacy.

## [](#the-module-tree)The module tree

Modules are structured in a _hierarchy_, the module tree, which is similar to the file tree of the source files. There are two kinds of modules: <wdautohl-customtag style="font-weight:bold;color:red;font-size:inherit;display:inline;" id="wdautohl_id_3" class="wdautohl_aW5saW5l">Inline</wdautohl-customtag> modules and ‚Äúnormal‚Äù modules:

    mod inline {
        // content of the module
    }

    mod normal;
    // the content is in another file

These are <wdautohl-customtag style="font-weight:bold;color:red;font-size:inherit;display:inline;" id="wdautohl_id_5" class="wdautohl_ZnVuY3Rpb25hbGx5">functionally</wdautohl-customtag> equivalent. If the content of an <wdautohl-customtag style="font-weight:bold;color:red;font-size:inherit;display:inline;" id="wdautohl_id_6" class="wdautohl_aW5saW5l">inline</wdautohl-customtag> module is very long, move it to another file, to keep the code neat and manageable.

When the module is not <wdautohl-customtag style="font-weight:bold;color:red;font-size:inherit;display:inline;" id="wdautohl_id_7" class="wdautohl_aW5saW5l">inline</wdautohl-customtag>, Rust looks for the content of the module in another file, either `_module_name_.rs` or `_module_name_/mod.rs`. It might seem odd that we have to declare modules explicitly (unlike in Python, where modules are <wdautohl-customtag style="font-weight:bold;color:red;font-size:inherit;display:inline;" id="wdautohl_id_8" class="wdautohl_aW5mZXI_">inferred</wdautohl-customtag> from the file system). However, there are good reasons for this, as we‚Äôll see later.

Like every tree, the module tree has a _root_. This is the file `lib.rs` in case of a library crate, or the file `main.rs` in case of a binary crate <sup class="footnote">[[1](#_footnotedef_1 "View footnote.")]</sup>.

### [](#submodules)Submodules

Unfortunately, Rust is not the most consistent language when it comes to modules: There are two different ways to structure a module tree, and they can be mixed within the same crate.

Say we have a library crate with a module `parent`, which contains a sub-module `child`:

    ‚îî‚îÄ library root
       ‚îî‚îÄ parent
          ‚îî‚îÄ child

The crate root is in a `lib.rs` file in the `src` directory. However, the `parent` module can be either in a `parent.rs` file next to `lib.rs`, or in a `mod.rs` file in a `parent` directory:

File tree A

    ‚îú‚îÄ Cargo.toml
    ‚îî‚îÄ src/
       ‚îú‚îÄ lib.rs
       ‚îú‚îÄ parent.rs  // parent module
       ‚îî‚îÄ parent/
          ‚îî‚îÄ child.rs

File tree B

    ‚îú‚îÄ Cargo.toml
    ‚îî‚îÄ src/
       ‚îú‚îÄ lib.rs
       ‚îî‚îÄ parent/
          ‚îú‚îÄ mod.rs  // parent module
          ‚îî‚îÄ child.rs

It doesn‚Äôt really matter which way you go, just do what you prefer. I use the first way (‚ÄúFile tree A‚Äù), since it‚Äôs easier to add sub-modules. For example, if you want to add a submodule to `child`, you just need to create a folder and a new file, and add a `mod` declaration:

     ‚îú‚îÄ Cargo.toml
     ‚îî‚îÄ src/
        ‚îú‚îÄ lib.rs
        ‚îú‚îÄ parent.rs
        ‚îî‚îÄ parent/
           ‚îú‚îÄ child.rs
          ‚îî‚îÄ child/
              ‚îî‚îÄ grand_child.rs

The path of a module can also be specified explicitly with the [`#[path]`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/modules.html#the-path-attribute) attribute, but this is rarely used in practice.

### [](#an-example)An example

Hopefully this will make more sense once you see an example. Here‚Äôs the module structure of a library crate:

    ‚îú‚îÄ Cargo.toml
    ‚îî‚îÄ src/
       ‚îú‚îÄ lib.rs
       ‚îú‚îÄ foo.rs
       ‚îú‚îÄ bar.rs
       ‚îî‚îÄ bar/
          ‚îî‚îÄ baz.rs

lib.rs

    // root module

    pub mod foo;
    pub mod bar;

bar.rs

    pub mod baz;

    pub use baz::*;
    pub use crate::foo::Answer;

foo.rs

    mod answer {
        pub struct Answer(pub i32);
    }

    pub use answer::Answer;

baz.rs

    use super::Answer;

    pub fn answer() -> Answer {
        Answer(42)
    }

No worries if you don‚Äôt understand everything here! All the concepts that are used here will be explained. You can look at this example later and see if you understand everything. For now, do you know what the module tree is?

## [](#items-and-paths)Items and paths

A module contains _items_. Items are

*   Functions

*   Types (structs, enums, unions, type <wdautohl-customtag style="font-weight:bold;color:red;font-size:inherit;display:inline;" id="wdautohl_id_9" class="wdautohl_YWxpYXM_">aliases</wdautohl-customtag>)

*   Traits

*   Impl blocks

*   Macros

*   Constants and statics

*   <wdautohl-customtag style="font-weight:bold;color:red;font-size:inherit;display:inline;" id="wdautohl_id_10" class="wdautohl_ZXh0ZXJu">Extern</wdautohl-customtag> blocks

*   <wdautohl-customtag style="font-weight:bold;color:red;font-size:inherit;display:inline;" id="wdautohl_id_11" class="wdautohl_ZXh0ZXJu">Extern</wdautohl-customtag> crates

*   Imports

*   Modules

*   Associated items (not important right now)

You can refer to items by their _path_. For example, the path `foo::bar::Baz` refers to the `Baz` item within the `bar` item within the `foo` item. Paths are usually relative: To use `foo::bar::Baz`, the `foo` item must be available in the current scope; absolute paths (starting at the root module) are <wdautohl-customtag style="font-weight:bold;color:red;font-size:inherit;display:inline;" id="wdautohl_id_12" class="wdautohl_cHJlZml4">prefixed</wdautohl-customtag> with `crate::`. A `super::` path segment changes to the parent module (similar to `../` in the file system).

_Imports_ are used to <wdautohl-customtag style="font-weight:bold;color:red;font-size:inherit;display:inline;" id="wdautohl_id_13" class="wdautohl_c2hvcnRlbg__">shorten</wdautohl-customtag> paths. Instead of having to write `foo::bar::Baz` every time, we can write `use foo::bar::Baz;` once. This brings the item into scope, so we can refer to it with the much shorter path `Baz`.

<table>

<tbody>

<tr>

<td class="content">Changes to paths in the 2018 edition

Prior to the 2018 edition, absolute paths started with just `::` instead of `crate::`. In the 2018 edition, this syntax is still available, but it‚Äôs not recommended and can only be used for external crates.

In the 2015 edition, imports were always absolute, even when they weren‚Äôt <wdautohl-customtag style="font-weight:bold;color:red;font-size:inherit;display:inline;" id="wdautohl_id_14" class="wdautohl_cHJlZml4">prefixed</wdautohl-customtag> with `::`. This was fixed in the 2018 edition for more consistency.

The 2018 edition also changed how external crates are used: In the 2015 edition, to use an external crate, an `extern crate` declaration was needed. This is no longer required in most cases: We can just put <wdautohl-customtag style="font-weight:bold;color:red;font-size:inherit;display:inline;" id="wdautohl_id_15" class="wdautohl_ZGVwZW5kZW5jeQ__">dependencies</wdautohl-customtag> in our `Cargo.toml`, and use them right away.

## [](#visibility)Visibility

_Visibility_, or _privacy_, is the concept of making parts of a module <wdautohl-customtag style="font-weight:bold;color:red;font-size:inherit;display:inline;" id="wdautohl_id_16" class="wdautohl_aW5hY2Nlc3NpYmxl">inaccessible</wdautohl-customtag> from other modules. Things that are only accessible in the same module are called _private_, and things that are accessible everywhere are called _public_.

<table>

<tbody>

<tr>

<td class="content">

This concept exists in many programming languages. However, in most object-<wdautohl-customtag style="font-weight:bold;color:red;font-size:inherit;display:inline;" id="wdautohl_id_17" class="wdautohl_b3JpZW50">oriented</wdautohl-customtag> languages, the privacy boundary is the _class_, whereas in Rust, the modules are privacy boundaries.

</td>

</tr>

</tbody>

</table>

In Rust, most things are private by default. To make something public, the `pub` <wdautohl-customtag style="font-weight:bold;color:red;font-size:inherit;display:inline;" id="wdautohl_id_18" class="wdautohl_a2V5d29yZA__">keyword</wdautohl-customtag> is written before it. This makes the item accessible everywhere:

lib.rs

    mod foo {  (1)
        pub mod bar {
            struct Baz;
        }
        // use bar::Baz;  (2)
    }

    use foo::bar;  (3)

<table>

<tbody>

<tr>

<td>**1**</td>

<td>This declares a private module, so it can only be used within this root module. It can‚Äôt be accessed from another crate.</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>**2**</td>

<td>If we uncommented this, it would fail to compile. `Baz` is private, therefore it can only be used within the `bar` module.</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td>**3**</td>

<td>The module `bar` can be used here, because it is declared as public. This is somewhat counter-intuitive, since the `foo` module is private. But when a module is private, it can still be accessed within its direct parent module, since a module is just like any other item.</td>

</tr>

</tbody>

</table>

### [](#encapsulation)<wdautohl-customtag style="font-weight:bold;color:red;font-size:inherit;display:inline;" id="wdautohl_id_19" class="wdautohl_ZW5jYXBzdWxhdGlvbg__">Encapsulation</wdautohl-customtag>

When designing an API, there are often _invariants_ that need to be preserved. An <wdautohl-customtag style="font-weight:bold;color:red;font-size:inherit;display:inline;" id="wdautohl_id_20" class="wdautohl_aW52YXJpYW50">invariant</wdautohl-customtag> is a property that never changes. For example, a struct might contain a value that is supposed to always be within the interval [0; 360):

    pub struct Angle(pub f32);

Let‚Äôs write a `new` function that validates this <wdautohl-customtag style="font-weight:bold;color:red;font-size:inherit;display:inline;" id="wdautohl_id_21" class="wdautohl_aW52YXJpYW50">invariant</wdautohl-customtag>, and a getter for the value:

    impl Angle {
        pub fn new(value: f32) -> Self {
            Angle(value.rem_euclid(360.0)) (1)
        }

        pub fn value(&self) -> f32 {
            self.0
        }
    }

<table>

<tbody>

<tr>

<td>**1**</td>

<td>[`rem_euclid`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.f32.html#method.rem_euclid) calculates the least nonnegative remainder of `self (mod rhs)`.</td>

</tr>

</tbody>

</table>

By ensuring that the angle is always in [0; 360), we can implement operations such as equality (where 0¬∞ == 360¬∞) very easily. But wait! Since the field is public, a user of the API can create an `Angle` object without calling the `new` function, or modify it without checking the <wdautohl-customtag style="font-weight:bold;color:red;font-size:inherit;display:inline;" id="wdautohl_id_22" class="wdautohl_aW52YXJpYW50">invariant</wdautohl-customtag>.

By making the field private, the struct‚Äôs implementation details are hidden. This is called _encapsulation_: Within this module, we still have to take special care that the <wdautohl-customtag style="font-weight:bold;color:red;font-size:inherit;display:inline;" id="wdautohl_id_23" class="wdautohl_aW52YXJpYW50">invariant</wdautohl-customtag> is preserved, but if the code is correct, the public API is impossible to use incorrectly.

### [](#fine-grained-visibility)Fine-grained visibility

Items can be private or public. However, there are also visibilities in-between: Most notably, an item can be declared as `pub(crate)`. This means that it is visible _within the current crate_, but not outside. With `pub(super)`, an item is visible within the parent module. With `pub(in _path_)`, visibility can also be limited to any other module as well:

    pub(crate) mod foo {
        pub(super) fn bar() {}
        pub(in crate::foo) struct Baz;
    }

When something is visible in one module, it is also visible in all its child modules. It still needs to be imported (or referred to with its path) though:

    struct Foo;
    // Foo is visible in this module

    mod inner {
        use super::Foo;
        // Foo is also visible here!
    }

### [](#visibilities-overview)Visibilities overview

</td>

</tr>

</tbody>

## [](#exports)Exports

With `pub use` declarations, items can be _re-exported_ from a different module than the one they were declared in. A re-exported item has multiple paths that refer to the same thing. For example:

lib.rs

    pub mod answer {
        pub const ANSWER: i32 = 42;
    }
    pub use answer::ANSWER;

Now `ANSWER` can be referred to as either `crate::ANSWER` or `crate‚Äã::answer::ANSWER`. However, not every path is always <wdautohl-customtag style="font-weight:bold;color:red;font-size:inherit;display:inline;" id="wdautohl_id_26" class="wdautohl_cmVhY2hhYmxl">reachable</wdautohl-customtag>. Take, for example:

lib.rs

    mod answer {
        pub const ANSWER: i32 = 42;
    }
    pub use answer::ANSWER;

`crate‚Äã::answer::ANSWER` is public, but it can‚Äôt be used from outside the crate, because the `answer` module is private. Only the re-export `crate::ANSWER` can be used from outside the crate.

## [](#common-pitfalls)Common <wdautohl-customtag style="font-weight:bold;color:red;font-size:inherit;display:inline;" id="wdautohl_id_27" class="wdautohl_cGl0ZmFsbA__">pitfalls</wdautohl-customtag>

<dl>

<dt class="hdlist1">The module tree must be built manually.</dt>

<dd>

There‚Äôs no <wdautohl-customtag style="font-weight:bold;color:red;font-size:inherit;display:inline;" id="wdautohl_id_28" class="wdautohl_aW1wbGljaXQ_">implicit</wdautohl-customtag> mapping from the _file system tree_ to the _module tree_: We need to declare all modules with the `mod` <wdautohl-customtag style="font-weight:bold;color:red;font-size:inherit;display:inline;" id="wdautohl_id_29" class="wdautohl_a2V5d29yZA__">keyword</wdautohl-customtag>.

</dd>

<dt class="hdlist1">Don‚Äôt confuse _visibility_ with _reachability_.</dt>

<dd>

The visibility of an item is like an _upper bound_, it can‚Äôt be increased with re-exports. For example, we can‚Äôt re-export a private struct outside of its module.

However, a public item might not be <wdautohl-customtag style="font-weight:bold;color:red;font-size:inherit;display:inline;" id="wdautohl_id_30" class="wdautohl_cmVhY2hhYmxl">reachable</wdautohl-customtag> from outside the crate, if it‚Äôs in a private module and isn‚Äôt publicly re-exported. To make an item available in the crate root, it‚Äôs not enough to make it public; we also need to make it <wdautohl-customtag style="font-weight:bold;color:red;font-size:inherit;display:inline;" id="wdautohl_id_31" class="wdautohl_cmVhY2hhYmxl">reachable</wdautohl-customtag> from the crate root.

</dd>

<dt class="hdlist1">Don‚Äôt confuse _visibility_ with _availability_.</dt>

<dd>

Visibility means that we are <wdautohl-customtag style="font-weight:bold;color:red;font-size:inherit;display:inline;" id="wdautohl_id_32" class="wdautohl_cHJpbmNpcGFsbHk_">principally</wdautohl-customtag> allowed to use an item somewhere. It doesn‚Äôt mean that the item is available, i.e. _in scope_, so we might still have to import it (or refer to it with its path).

</dd>

</dl>

## [](#special-cases)Special cases

There are a few language constructs that don‚Äôt adhere to the same rules as everything else:

### [](#enum-variants-and-fields)Enum variants and fields

Enum variants and variant fields are always public, and it‚Äôs not possible to make them private. Therefore we should be careful when exposing enums publicly, because changing the variants or fields later is not backwards compatible.

You can add the [`#[non_exhaustive]`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/reference/attributes/type_system.html#the-non_exhaustive-attribute) attribute to an enum to allow adding more variants later. This mean that the enum can‚Äôt be matched <wdautohl-customtag style="font-weight:bold;color:red;font-size:inherit;display:inline;" id="wdautohl_id_33" class="wdautohl_ZXhoYXVzdGl2ZWx5">exhaustively</wdautohl-customtag>; we‚Äôll always need to add a wildcard match arm (`_ => {}`).

Sometimes it‚Äôs a good idea to wrap an enum in a struct to hide the implementation details:

    pub struct Foo(FooImpl); // FooImpl is private

    enum FooImpl {
        // ...
    }

Also, when an enum variant has multiple fields, it‚Äôs usually better to put them in a separate struct, so it‚Äôs possible to make the fields private or make the struct `non_exhaustive`:

    // Instead of this:
    pub enum Foo {
        Variant {
            field: i32,
            other_field: bool,
        }
    }

    // do this:
    pub enum Foo {
        Variant(FooVariant),
    }
    pub struct FooVariant {
        field: i32,
        other_field: bool,
    }

### [](#macros)Macros

<wdautohl-customtag style="font-weight:bold;color:red;font-size:inherit;display:inline;" id="wdautohl_id_34" class="wdautohl_ZGVjbGFyYXRpdmU_">Declarative</wdautohl-customtag> macros (the ones that are declared with `macro_rules!`) behave more like local variables within a function than like items in some regards. For example, they can be shadowed, they have to be declared before they can be used, and they don‚Äôt need to be explicitly imported in child modules <sup class="footnote">[[2](#_footnotedef_2 "View footnote.")]</sup>.

And, they can‚Äôt be declared public. The `#[macro_export]` attribute can be added to a macro, which exports it publicly at the crate root. This can be <wdautohl-customtag style="font-weight:bold;color:red;font-size:inherit;display:inline;" id="wdautohl_id_35" class="wdautohl_dW5kZXNpcmFibGU_">undesirable</wdautohl-customtag>, however, if it‚Äôs not supposed to be part of the public API; there is no equivalent of `pub(crate)` for macros.

One workaround for this is to put our macros in a module and <wdautohl-customtag style="font-weight:bold;color:red;font-size:inherit;display:inline;" id="wdautohl_id_36" class="wdautohl_YW5ub3RhdGU_">annotate</wdautohl-customtag> the module with `#[macro_use]`. The module should be the _first module declaration_ in the crate root. This ensures that the macros can be used everywhere in our crate, but not outside of the crate. Not the most elegant solution, but it works.

## [](#why-are-modules-declared-explicitly)Why are modules declared explicitly?

I promised to explain why modules have to be declared explicitly. There are a few reasons:

1.  With the [`#[path]`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/modules.html#the-path-attribute) attribute, a module can be located in a different directory, or have a different name than the file.

2.  Module declarations can have a visibility, e.g. `pub(crate) mod foo;`

3.  Sometimes there are files which you don‚Äôt want to include in the module tree.

    For example, a crate with both a library and a binary target usually contains a `lib.rs` file for the library and a `main.rs` file for the binary. Submodules are stored in the same directory, but some modules are only needed by the library, and some only by the binary. By specifying the modules explicitly, you can include only the necessary modules in each file.


Until next time!
